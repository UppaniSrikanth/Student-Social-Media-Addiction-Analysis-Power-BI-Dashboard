## ⚙️ Data Preparation Process
1. **Data Extraction using SQL:** Retrieved data from the student dataset stored in SQL Server.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query:**
   - Removed null and duplicate values.
   - Standardized column names.
   - Created calculated columns (e.g., Average Addiction Score, Academic Impact %).
   - Filtered irrelevant data and formatted the dataset for visualization.
3. **Data Modeling in Power BI:** Established relationships between tables and applied data types.
4. **DAX Calculations:** Built measures like `Avg_Usage_Hours`, `Avg_Sleep_Hours`, and `Avg_Addiction_Score` to enhance insights.
